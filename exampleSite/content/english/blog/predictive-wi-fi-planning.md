A Wi-Fi Predictive Planning requires a copy of your site plans and a description of your built environment, which is then fed into a specialist wireless simulation tool to create a virtual model of your predicted RF environment.

Once we have modelled the predicted RF environment of your site we place virtual access points in different location to then estimate your expected signal strength, signal-to-noise ratio and coverage. We will then adjust the AP count and locations in order to create a WLAN designed for your environment that will allow you to achieve your wireless goals.

### What will the Predictive Site Survey Show?

This survey will be able to predict:

* **Signal Strength**
* **Signal-to-Noise Ratio , based on channel overlap**
* **PHY Rates**
* **Signal Coverage**
* **Data Rates**

### What will I get after the survey?

After our engineer has reviewed your site, you will be given a report and heat maps that detail all of the information listed above. Most importantly you will get recommendations and advice for your WLAN project.
