There are three different types of Pre-Deployment Site Surveys, Active Surveys, Passive Surveys and Hybrid Surveys. An Active Survey uses an adapter to measure packets in two directions (send and receive), it is then associated with a number of access points and used to measure round trip times, throughput rates etc. The Active Survey is great for analysing a wireless set-up.

A Passive Site Survey, uses a wireless adapter that is not associated to any WLANs but will passively listen to the wireless traffic. These are great for system design purposes.

The Hybrid Site Survey, which is the Pre-Deployment Survey we perform, combines both the active and passive site surveys together to provide both the engineer and client with the most amounts of data possible. The Hybrid Survey is extremely accurate and should be carried out if you’re planning a new wireless network for any large or complex sites.

Please note this can be used for both indoor and outdoor wireless deployments.

### What will the Pre-Deployment Site Survey Show?

The Pre-Deployment Site Survey will accurately predict:

* **Signal Strength**
* **Signal-to-Noise Ratio**
* **PHY Rates**
* **Signal Coverage**
* **Sources of Interference**
* **Data Rates**

### How is this different from the Predictive Site Survey?

With a Pre-Deployment Site Survey we take into account your live RF environment, and can pick up on sources of interference that may have not been considered when completing a Predictive Site Survey. This allows us to create a more accurate report, heat map, AP count and recommendations.

### What will I get after the survey?

Once the engineer has gathered all the information from your site, he will analyse it with specialist wireless software and build a set of detailed report and heat maps, detailing all of the information listed above, which you will be supplied with.

Please be aware in order to provide a set of heat maps, we do require some accurate floor plans for your site. If you don’t have any plans available, we can still provide all the information listed above.
