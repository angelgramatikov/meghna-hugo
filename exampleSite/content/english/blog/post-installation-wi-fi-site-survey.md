+++
You’ve planned your wireless network meticulously, you have undertaken both the Wi-Fi Planning and Pre-Deployment Surveys and now your wireless is up and running. The only job left to do is confirm that your network is providing you with the predicted coverage, connectivity and capacity. To do this we carry out a Post Installation Survey, also referred to as a Validation Survey.

A Post-Installation Survey should be carried out for all large and complex wireless projects, in order to review whether your system is running as expected, and to further perfect your WLAN.

Like the Pre-Deployment Site Survey, this requires a trained engineer to visit your site and run a series of tests with specialist software capable of interpreting your wireless (RF) signal in order to analyse your WLAN.

You’ll receive a set of heat maps for your site providing an accurate visual representation of the coverage, connectivity and capacity of your new WLAN. It will also highlight any areas that may need additional coverage, as well as any potential problem areas.

### What will the Post Installation Site Survey Show?

The validation site survey will accurately show details of your new installation, detailing:

* **Signal Strength**
* **Signal-to-Noise Ratio**
* **PHY Rates**
* **Signal Coverage**
* **Sources of Interference**
* **Data Rates**

### What will I get after the survey?

Once the engineer has gathered all the information from your site, you will be given a detailed report and a set of heat maps.
