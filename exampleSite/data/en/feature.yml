  title: 'Critical Wireless Design Aspects and RF Design Process '
  content: |-
    Both capacity and coverage are important to our professional design. It is simple enough to cover the areas where signal is required, and it is undoubtedly an important factor.

    Coverage, however, is simply insufficient.  The variety and quantity of devices being utilised, as well as the apps being used on those devices, are all taken into consideration while designing a wireless network. A competent hotel wireless solution does not mean to merely increase the number of access points and to cross your fingers.

    A word of caution: adding more access points will likely cause more problems and cost money.

    For this reason, we have included the most crucial and significant components and methods we employ below.
