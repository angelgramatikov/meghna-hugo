  - name: Predictive Wi-Fi Planning
    icon: ti-check-box
    content: Before any wireless project we recommend getting a Wi-Fi Predictive Planning.  We
      will run your site plans through our special wireless software (Ekahau AI),
      create your virtual RF environment and analyse your site. This allows us to
      make some informed predictions of your AP count, signal level and signal-to-noise
      ratio, which is all documented on a heat map report that you will be issued
      with at the end.
  - name: Pre-Deployment Wi-Fi Site Survey
    icon: ti-check-box
    content: For larger or more complex sites, in addition to the predictive site
      survey we recommend having a Pre-Deployment Hybrid Site Survey. This survey
      requires one of our wireless engineers visiting your site and running a multitude
      of wireless tests. They will measure for packet loss, maximum throughputs, signal
      coverage and signal strength to accurately predict your wireless performance
      and kit list. This is charged out at a daily rate. Once all the data has been
      collected, the engineer will draw up your detailed wireless report and live
      heat maps.
  - name: Post Installation Wi-Fi Site Survey
    icon: ti-check-box
    content: You’ve planned your wireless network meticulously, you have undertaken
      both the Wi-Fi Planning and Pre-Deployment Surveys and now your wireless is
      up and running. The only way you can confirm that your network is providing
      you with the predicted coverage, connectivity and capacity is to carry out a
      Validation Survey, also referred to as a Post Installation Survey.
  - name: Wi-Fi Troubleshooting and Health Check Survey
    icon: ti-check-box
    content: We have a lot of clients approach us with an existing wireless solution
      that they have invested heavily in, but that isn’t delivering on its promises.
      You may be experiencing interference, dead spots or connectivity issues to name
      but a few. We can use our wireless know-how, trained engineers and specialist
      software to analyse your site and perform and Troubleshooting and Health Check
      exercise to find the source of and solution for your problems.
