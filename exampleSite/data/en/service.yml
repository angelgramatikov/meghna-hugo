      A predictive Wi-Fi planning is based on layouts and drawings of the location or building. This information is then fed into a predictive survey software (Ekahau AI) which then provides estimates based on the information provided.

      This is a more cost-effective option if you are looking for a quick turnaround for estimated pricing for a Wi-Fi installation.
  - name: Passive Wi-Fi Site Survey
    icon: ti-check-box
    content: A physical walk-through of the site ensures that all factors that may
      impact network performance are accounted for. The surveying tool (Ekahau AI)
      is not connected to the Wi-Fi network during the walk-through and only listens
      to the Wi-Fi environment. The survey software scans specific channels and networks
      to measure signal strength, signal-to-noise ratios, and interference.
  - name: Active Wi-Fi Site Survey
    icon: ti-check-box
    content: An active site survey is similar to a passive survey, but the survey
      tool (Ekahau AI) is connected to the wireless access points. This allows for
      an array of information to be gathered, like network traffic, round-trip-time
      (RTT), throughput, and upload/download speeds.
