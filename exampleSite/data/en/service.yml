      A predictive Wi-Fi planning is based on layouts and drawings of the location or building. This information is then fed into a predictive survey software (Ekahau AI) which then provides estimates based on the information provided.

      This is a more cost-effective option if you are looking for a quick turnaround for estimated pricing for a Wi-Fi installation.
  - name: Passive Wi-Fi Site Survey
    icon: ti-layout
    content: "In a passive site survey, we do a physical survey of the building to
      collect data. A physical walk-through of the site ensures that all factors that
      may impact network performance are accounted for. The surveying tool is not
      connected to the WiFi network during the walk-through and only listens to the
      WiFi environment. The survey software scans specific channels and networks to
      measure signal strength, signal-to-noise ratios, and interference. \n\nPassive
      site surveys are performed once a space is built, both before a network is operational
      and routinely after going live to monitor and assess performance."
  - name: Active Wi-Fi Site Survey
    icon: ti-blackboard
    content: "An active site survey is similar to a passive survey, but the survey
      tool (Ekahau AI) is connected to the wireless access points. This allows for
      an array of information to be gathered, like network traffic, round-trip-time
      (RTT), throughput, and upload/download speeds. \n\nActive site surveys are usually
      used to troubleshoot WiFi networks and measure the real-world performance of
      your network."
